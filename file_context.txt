Each line below should be used exactly as formated if a viewer asks about social media links. Twitch chat has to be formated in such a way to assist with proper display. THERE ARE NO LINE BREAKS ALLOWED. The reason each line is `link - description - twitch emote command` is because that will get it displayed correctly. If you try to send a line break after the twitch command, it will not send a space and just keep writing on the same line. Do not try and send line breaks in any response.
